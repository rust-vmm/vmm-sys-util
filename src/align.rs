//! Miscellaneous macros related to align addresses

/// Aligns the given address downwards to the nearest boundary specified by
/// `alignment`.
///
/// This macro ensures that the result is the largest address less than or equal
/// to `addr` that is aligned to `alignment`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `$addr` - The address or value to align downwards.
/// * `$alignment` - The alignment boundary, which must be a power of two.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// The macro will panic if `$alignment` is not a power of two.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use vmm_sys_util::align_downwards;
///
/// let addr: usize = 10;
/// let alignment: usize = 4; // Must be a power of two
/// let aligned = align_downwards!(addr, alignment);
/// assert_eq!(aligned, 8);
/// ```
