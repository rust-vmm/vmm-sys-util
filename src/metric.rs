//! The purpose of this module is to provide abstractions for working with
//! metrics in the context of rust-vmm components where there is a strong need
//! to have metrics as an optional feature.
//!
//! As multiple stakeholders are using these components, there are also
//! questions regarding the serialization format, as metrics are expected to be
//! flexible enough to allow different formatting, serialization and writers.
//! When using the rust-vmm metrics, the expectation is that VMMs built on top
//! of these components can choose what metrics theyâ€™re interested in and also
//! can add their own custom metrics without the need to maintain forks.
